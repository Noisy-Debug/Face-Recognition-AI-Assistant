How to Create a .exe File for Your Face Recognition AI Assistant
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open your Project Folder in VS Code.
2. Run the AI assistant Python file (AI ASSISTANT.py).
3. Use the menu to capture your face samples.
4. After capturing, train the model using the same interface.
5. Test the assistant to ensure it is working correctly.

6. Once everything is Verified, Create the .exe:
   - Open terminal in VS Code.
   - Navigate to your Project Directory if needed:
     cd Path\To\Your\Project Folder
   - Run the following command:
     pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "1-DATA;1-DATA" --add-data "3-TRAINER;3-TRAINER" PORTABLE.py

7. The executable (.exe) file will be created in the 'dist' folder: dist\PORTABLE.exe

8. After completing all steps and verifying the `.exe` works correctly, you can delete all other files and folders except the `dist` folder and keep only the `.exe` file for portable use.

Now you can copy the .exe file to a USB drive and run it on any Windows system without installing Python.
